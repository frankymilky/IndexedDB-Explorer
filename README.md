# IndexedDB Explorer
**attempt to make a indexeddb file explorer**

**TO DO:**
- Ability to Download files
- Ability to Upload files
- Ability to preview txt, json, etc.

## Whats the point of making this?
This allows people to be able to add files to certain web games that have soft coded mod support that wouldn't normally be possible on a web build.

**Example: [Mari0](https://stabyourself.net/mari0) has a mappack system, theoretically if you used a indexeddb file explorer and add a mappack into its data store it should load the map.
